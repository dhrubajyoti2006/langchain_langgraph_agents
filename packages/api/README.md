## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start the application.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Server

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start-server
    ```

### Testing the Server

Once the server is running, you can test it using the following URL:
- [http://localhost:3000/get/12345](http://localhost:3000/get/12345)

This will call the `get` endpoint with the ID `12345`.
